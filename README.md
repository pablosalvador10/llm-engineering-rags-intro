# LLM-Engineering-RAGs-Intro 🚀

Welcome to LLM-Engineering-RAGs-Intro, a collection of projects focused on the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models (LLMs) in engineering practices. The repository is designed as an introductory guide for leveraging the combined power of RAGs and LLMs to innovate and enhance efficiency within the engineering domain.

## Structure 📂

- 🛠️ **Projects**: Located in the `projects` folder, each project is a self-contained example demonstrating how to apply RAGs and LLMs to solve real-world engineering problems.  

- 🏗️ **System Designs**: The `system_designs` folder houses detailed designs and architectures that underpin the integration of RAGs and LLMs into engineering operations.
